# nilmtk-help

@Wusir2018

Did you ever figure out how to run AFHMM and AFHMM_Exact using NILMtk?

I am currently experiencing the exact same issue. And have been unable to find anyone with a feasible solution.

The only person I found online with the same issue was you. 

Sorry for the random addition to this repository.

If you do have a solution or anything that helps could you add it to Issues.

Thank you!
